Additional information:
Incomplete and messy code - I attempted to finish as much as possible, but it's already 2 days late; any later I cannot offset the penalty with better code/functionality.

I am willing to meet if you'd like to discuss or want me to explain my code.

Bugs: 
-RR doesn't work as expected; gave up on that
-Scanning path file from keyboard does not work; needs manual edit (line 96)
-Does not detect mismatching TNCPU vs. CPUn
